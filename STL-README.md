## Credit where credit is due

The stand was created by Denny77 Dec 2017, https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2689401  
I made it larger, but otherwise it's his design.  

The lid is my own creation, I'm not very good at making lids yet, but this one works.  

The case is a remix of my TTGO Teight case https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3634368  
I made it taller, then because the MAX232 board is slightly larger, I stuck a larger box on top (or bottom depending on how you look at it.) This give a interesting two layer effect.  
I ended up cutting the openning for the 9 Pin port a little bit to get the board to fit a little better, and the 9 pin gender changer is used to help hold it in place.  

I took a guess on the size the stand should be, and happy accident it fit almost perfect (honestly it's just slightly too big, but that makes it easy to slide the case in and out).  

So what wasn't planned, turned out to be a good fit for the case.
