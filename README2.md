## Robot Code

Included is one example of controlling a robot over WiFi with the Tandy 102.  
arexx_d1_mini_telnet_controlled_robot_test_code - this is basicly a telnet server running on a D1 Mini (ESP8266) board, connected to the D1 Mini Motor Shield, using a general/genic 2 wheeled robot plateform.  
In the Tandy102_Robot_Code directory, you'll find the basic program that the Tandy 102 runs - it's pretty simple.  
Turn the SD WiFi card device on, selected the WiFi Modem, run the basic program, which should hit the enter key, connect to the D1 Mini Access Point, and make the robot move forward for a short time, and stop.  
It's just one example of what can be done.
